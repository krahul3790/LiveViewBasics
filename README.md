Playing around with LiveView Tutorials

# Motivation
The Beam virtual machine has been battle tested for soft-real time systems. 
Elixir language abstracts away the complexity of programming in Erlang. 
Phoenix Live View brings in the real time collaborative aspects in an application. 

Idea is to explore the real time aspects of the Phoenix Live View and get exposed to the internal workings of Beam eventually.
